        üì∏ What kind of photos should I upload to the platform?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        We recommend that you upload a variety of photos to ensure that your
        avatar is as accurate as possible. This may include close-up shots of
        your face, photos of your profile, and full-body shots. {`It's`}{" "}
        important to make sure that your photos are clear and of high quality,
        and that they do not include any other people or animals. We also
        recommend that you include a range of expressions, locations,
        backgrounds, and perspectives in your photos to create the most accurate
        avatar possible.

        üë©‚Äçüé® How similar will the avatar be to my appearance?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The accuracy of your avatar will largely depend on the number and
        variety of the photos that you provide. The better and more diverse the
        photos are, the easier it will be for the AI to understand and replicate
        your facial and bodily characteristics. As a result, your avatar will be
        more likely to closely resemble your actual appearance!

        üí∞ Is it possible to obtain a refund?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        It is possible to obtain a refund for purchases made within the first 14
        days, as long as you have not yet trained the AI. However, once the
        14-day period has passed or if you have already used the service (by
        clicking on the train button), you will no longer be eligible for a
        refund.

      <Text>
        Please ensure that you upload a sufficient number of high-quality photos
        to avoid disappointment with the generated avatars!
